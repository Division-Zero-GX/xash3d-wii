# Xash3D FWGS Engine (Wii Fork)

Xash3D FWGS is a fork of Xash3D Engine by Unkle Mike with extended features and crossplatform.


## How to run? (only for devs)

```
./waf configure -T release --Wii --dedicated --prefix==OUT --low-memory-mode=1
./waf build
```

**Note**
The port for the moment is pretty rough, with some awful linker messages.
